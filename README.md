# `.h` suggestions for libigl-style implementations for Geometry Processing final projects

These are _suggestions_ and representative of how to structure your
implementations. You _may_ modify them, but keep within the general libigl-style
guidelines of simple matrix types as inputs and outputs.

Remember, you must also prepare a libigl tutorial style `main.cpp` (typically
a demo with an interactive visualization of the results) and a markdown tutorial
text+images.
